            <h1>Learning Web Development</h1>
            <h3 class="univer">Programming Hero Course</h3>
            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and <br> e-commerce development.</p>

            <h1>Learning C Language</h1>
            <h3 class="univer">Teaching Myself</h3>
            <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
                lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that
                map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously
                coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software
                for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.</p>
